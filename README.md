# What is this repo?

This repo contains `pellet`s. These can be installed with
[MsPac](https://github.com/mjwhitta/mspac). A `pellet` is simply a
json file which contains the data required to fetch the source,
compile, install, and uninstall an opensource tool.

# Creating a new pellet

Copy the `pellet.sample` provided and fill in the `TODO`s with real
data.
